## Citation Tracker
---

### Basic idea:

Create an easy to use drag and drop application that keeps track of your articles. Articles should be easy to retrieve using a system that enables the user to tag articles with 1-10 words. The project is focussed on simplicity by providing a small GUI that can be interacted with by ether clicking it and opening a search menu or draging an article on it to save it. Another feature is that the articles are saved with their BibTex citations and this way the user can easily retrieve them when they want to write a protocol/paper using latex.
